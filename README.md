#Skosveinar

Welcome to our group project for Module 4.
We created this website with parents in Iceland in mind—especially those who struggle to find fun and unique gifts for their children during the season of the 13 Yule Lads. Our goal is to make it easier to discover original ideas, gather them in one place, and keep the overall budget relatively low.
Additionally, they can read and stay updated on which Santa Claus arrives at what time. 🎄
A brief description of what this project does and who it’s for.
